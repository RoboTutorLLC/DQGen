# DQGen
DQGen (Dynamic Question Generator) is an automated tool that inputs text from a user, generates multiple choice comprehension questions to ask while reading it, and emails the questions back to the user.

Sample files can be found [here](documentation/sample_files)

The DQGen/source_code/ folder is the too large with many resources for DQGen, so you can downlaod it from [our Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/16yIiYNcys6ZksrHPmZ3LWM0TE60ShScj).
